A few days after "the incident", and after some rest (what a crazy week ending), it's time for us to take a decision.


## Thank you so much


First of all, I'd like to **thank**:



	
  * those who relayed my messages

	
  * for the supporting emails, tweets and Flattrs

	
  * those who suggested a new name

	
  * those who offered their help

	
  * n1k0, low' and Gregoire_M for the translations

	
  * Framasoft for your help (more informations below)




## New identity


We want to move forward, we don't want to waste time, we want to work on the version 2 of our application as soon as possible.

That's why we've decided that it was wiser for us, legally and especially ethically, to change our name and therefore our logo.

Our deferred reading application will now be called **wallabag**.

Our web site: [http://www.wallabag.org](http://www.wallabag.org) and [http://www.wllbg.org](http://www.wllbg.org)

On IRC : [irc://irc.freenode.net/#wallabag](irc://irc.freenode.net/#wallabag) and [irc://irc.freenode.net/#wallabag-fr](irc://irc.freenode.net/#wallabag-fr) for the French speakers
Our email : [hello@wallabag.org](mailto:hello@wallabag.org)

Choosing a name is not a small matter, it must:



	
  * have a meaning

	
  * be short

	
  * be readable by a maximum of people since our application is used in several countries

	
  * not be already used :)

	
  * have an available domain name and social network identifier.


This name must also be liked. But as you know, not everyone will like it.

Some explainations about his name:
We derived from poche, to come to the wallaby, via the kangaroo. His pocket allows you to take away any thing you found interesting.
The concept of bag, handbag, beggar's bag, suitcase, etc. came back frequently in your proposals.

All of that has given **wallabag**.

Concerning the logo, we will also move forward in the coming days.

But we should not loose too many time on that. Indeed, it's important, but the most important thing is the application you'll use everyday. That's what we must focus on.

After this episode, Vincent and I will take over the development of the v2, I hope it will be released in 2014. Will this version will come a lot of good things, like [a collaboration with ownCloud](https://github.com/wallabag/wallabag/issues/408), we're also discussing with [Cozy](http://cozy.io/), [arkOS](https://arkos.io/), [YunoHost](https://doc.yunohost.org), etc.
Our application should make everyone happy with smartphone apps that handle the offline storage.

We all have a lot of ideas (you and us): we just have to **move forward**.


## Framasoft


For the French speakers, you may already know **[Framasoft](http://www.framasoft.net/)**. To sum up, Framasoft is an association that promotes open source. It has existed for ten years, and it employs a few persons.

A lot of projects are released every year by Framasoft, and one of them is Framacloud. Tho goal is to help people to use some open source softwares without the constraints of the installations, updates, etc.

Well … we know that! Yes, that's exactly what we propose too.

So our project will be a project of the Framasoft network. And it will be called Framabag.

The web site: [https://www.framabag.org](https://www.framabag.org)

For now, nothing will change. Well, almost nothing. But it insures an additional longevity to our project. The association will financially support us.
We will come back on that point shortly.

Anyway, thank you Framasoft for taking us under your wing!

**Now, let's go!**
