[Uberspace](https://uberspace.de/) is a german web hoster. Florian Lauck wrote a nice tutorial on [how to install poche on Uberspace](http://classmplanet.de/poche-on-uberspace/). Thank you Florian.

> The only drawback I have found so far is that there's no iOS client app, yet. On those devices, one can only use Poche via browser. However, there are apps for Android and Windows Phone.

With poche v2 (which is still in development), and its API, third applications will be able to make more great things, like offline reading. poche v2 will be released in 2014, I hope.
