Title: what is wallabag? 
URL:
save_as: index.html

wallabag (formerly poche) is a **self hostable application for saving web pages**. Unlike other services, wallabag is free (as in freedom) and open source.

With this application you will not miss content anymore. **Click, save, read it when you want**. It saves the content you select so that you can read it when you have time.

## How it works

Thanks to the bookmarklet or third-party applications, you save an article in your wallabag to read it later. Then, when you open your wallabag, **you can comfortably read your articles**.

## How to use wallabag

There are two ways to use wallabag: you can install it on your web server or you can create an account at Framabag (we install and upgrade wallabag for you).

## License

wallabag is released under the MIT license.
