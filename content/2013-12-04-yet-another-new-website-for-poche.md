title: Yet another new website for poche
tags: website

More than 8 months since I started poche development. And I released five websites. Wow. And here is the sixth one.

The old website was a static one, I made it too quickly and it was not so easy to edit.

Back to a CMS, I use wordpress. I'm not a wordpress fan, but it does the job.

About content, no huge changes. The [blog](http://www.wallabag.org/blog_index.html) is now hosted here, no more by Tumblr. You can now easily comment each post.
You can find great third applications in [Downloads]({filename}/pages/download.md) section (plugin for Tiny Tiny RSS, for Leed, and so on).
I still have to work on [poche hosting](https://www.framabag.org) website (you are more than 400 users, wow!) and the [documentation](http://doc.wallabag.org).

I think this website should not move before long time. I hope that poche has found its house.

## About poche


Since the latest release ([poche 1.2]({filename}/2013-11-25-poche-1-2-0.md)), I added RSS to poche 1.x. So, with poche 1.3, you will be able to read your poched links in your favorite RSS reader. This version will be available during the last week of 2013.

[Vincent Jousse](http://twitter.com/vjousse) has joined poche team. Vincent and I will work on poche v2. If you are interested, y ou can have a look to [this branch](https://github.com/wallabag/wallabag/tree/v2-silex). We will use Silex (a PHP framework).
