<h2>New identity</h2>
<p>We want to move forward, we don't want to waste time, we want to work on the version 2 of our application as soon as possible.</p>
<p>That's why we've decided that it was wiser for us, legally and especially ethically, to change our name and therefore our logo.</p>
<p>Our deferred reading application will now be called <strong>wallabag</strong>.</p>

Our email : <a href="mailto:hello@wallabag.org">hello@wallabag.org</a></p>
<p>Choosing a name is not a small matter, it must:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>have a meaning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>be short</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>be readable by a maximum of people since our application is used in several countries</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>not be already used :)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>have an available domain name and social network identifier.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This name must also be liked. But as you know, not everyone will like it.</p>
<p>Some explainations about his name:
We derived from poche, to come to the wallaby, via the kangaroo. His pocket allows you to take away any thing you found interesting.
The concept of bag, handbag, beggar's bag, suitcase, etc. came back frequently in your proposals.</p>
<p>All of that has given <strong>wallabag</strong>.</p>
<p>Concerning the logo, we will also move forward in the coming days.</p>
<p>But we should not loose too many time on that. Indeed, it's important, but the most important thing is the application you'll use everyday. That's what we must focus on.</p>
<p>After this episode, Vincent and I will take over the development of the v2, I hope it will be released in 2014. Will this version will come a lot of good things, like <a href="https://github.com/wallabag/wallabag/issues/408">a collaboration with ownCloud</a>, we're also discussing with <a href="http://cozy.io/">Cozy</a>, <a href="https://arkos.io/">arkOS</a>, <a href="https://doc.yunohost.org">YunoHost</a>, etc.
Our application should make everyone happy with smartphone apps that handle the offline storage.</p>
<p>We all have a lot of ideas (you and us): we just have to <strong>move forward</strong>.</p>
<h2>Framasoft</h2>
<p>For the French speakers, you may already know <strong><a href="http://www.framasoft.net/">Framasoft</a></strong>. To sum up, Framasoft is an association that promotes open source. It has existed for ten years, and it employs a few persons.</p>
<p>A lot of projects are released every year by Framasoft, and one of them is Framacloud. Tho goal is to help people to use some open source softwares without the constraints of the installations, updates, etc.</p>
<p>Well … we know that! Yes, that's exactly what we propose too.</p>
<p>So our project will be a project of the Framasoft network. And it will be called Framabag.</p>
<p>The web site: <a href="https://www.framabag.org">https://www.framabag.org</a></p>
<p>For now, nothing will change. Well, almost nothing. But it insures an additional longevity to our project. The association will financially support us.
We will come back on that point shortly.</p>
<p>Anyway, thank you Framasoft for taking us under your wing!</p>
<p><strong>Now, let's go!</strong></p>

                <h2><a href="https://www.wallabag.org/blog/2014/01/25/pocket-reply">Pocket reply</a></h2>
                <div class="summary"><p>Nate Weiner, Founder / CEO at Pocket, replied me:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hey Nicolas,</p>
<p>I wanted to reach out and reply to your open letter directly.</p>
<p>I have no issue with you creating an open source service like Pocket. I’ve appreciated the number of similar products in our space as it means there are a lot more people helping to drive the idea and space forward. It's exciting to see it evolve and it's great that you are a part of that.</p>
<p>Likewise, I'm a strong believer in open source. I used to do volunteer work as an AMO Editor at Mozilla because I believed in what they were doing. I poured months of time into my own free, open source project, ShareKit, that hundreds of iOS apps have used to help users share with each other. And most importantly, without open source code to help in the early years, Pocket probably wouldn't be what it is today. Open source is a critical component for a flourishing development community.</p>
<p>Finally, I also understand what it's like to be a solo developer working on a project. For the first 3.5 years of it's life, Pocket was a solo, indie project and it was just me cranking away on it. There were a lot of potential scenarios to think about that kept me up at night.</p>
<p>That is why I was incredibly thoughtful about how I built this product and company. Because I wanted it to be around for a long time, it was important to me that it was built not just on a strong product foundation, but also a legal one too.</p>
<p>Two years ago, we decided to rebrand from Read It Later to Pocket. We spent a few months figuring out what name to build our future on. We had a list of names that was a mile long. There were others that we liked but that were already clearly established brands or conflicts and so we avoided them.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, “Poche”, which is literally the word “Pocket” in French, has created a strong likelihood of confusion and that's exactly what trademarks were created to help prevent. Confusion does not help anyone: our company nor yours. Most importantly, it does not help the users of our products if the two services end up confusing everyone. The confusion of our users is what we are trying to protect against.</p>
<p>“Poche” was clearly created as a service that was as close in name, brand and description to Pocket as possible. You have even described directly on its site specifically as an open source version of Pocket.</p>
<p>We registered the “Pocket” trademark as it relates to our products and services both in the United States and in the European Union, and our registration covers France. (See U.S. Trademark Reg. Nos. 4,354,899 and 4,354,900; Community Trademark No. 011111184.) Although we registered the English word, our trademark also protects us from the French-language equivalent when used on similar or related products or services.</p>
<p>If a foreign word or phrase translated into English is exactly the same as the existing English trademark, the marks are considered to be confusingly similar. As shown in cases such as Popular Bank of Florida v. Banco Popular de Puerto Rico, 9 F. Supp. 2d 1347, 1359 (S.D. Fla. 1998); General Conf. Corp. of Seventh-Day Adventists v. Perez, 97 F. Supp. 2d 1154 (S.D. Fla. 2000).</p>
<p>The U.S. courts and the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office both apply this rule. So, for example, “LUPO” was found to be confusingly similar to “WOLF”  (230 U.S.P.Q. 702), “CHAT NOIR” was confusingly similar to “BLACK CAT” (111 U.S.P.Q. 286),  “MARCHE  NOIR” was confusingly similar to “BLACK MARKET” (79 U.S.P.Q.2d 1021) and “LA PEREGRINA” was confusingly similar to “THE PILGRIM” (86 USPQ2d 1645).</p>
<p>Because you are using POCHE (which translates in English to POCKET) to offer a similar product and service, we believe our users around the world are likely to be confused and we have already started to see such confusion.</p>
<p>This is why I've asked you to change your service’s and company name and logo not to resemble Pocket. As one indie dev to another, my hope is that you'll find a name that is unique to you, your service and is something that you can build a true foundation on.</p>
<p>Thanks for your time,</p>
<p>Nate</p>

<p>My answer:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hello Nate,</p>
<p>I’m glad you sent that mail instead of your law firm. You know, open-source communities are open-minded and discussing is always possible.</p>
<p>I’m aware of the potential problem it could be for you. And for us, ethically, it’s not so good to have that name. My application has to have its own identity.</p>
<p>On my side, I’d like to go ahead and don’t want to waste any more time with that point. My application name will change in the next few days, and the same will happen to the logo.</p>
<p>You can tell your law firm that I won’t reply.</p>
<p>As this discussion is not confidential, I’ll publish your answer and mine on my blog.
I think that publishing your answer will show too your open-mindness. After that, I won’t publish anything else about that story.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Nicolas</p>

                <h2><a href="https://www.wallabag.org/blog/2014/01/24/open-letter-addressed-read-later-inc-creator-pocket">Open letter addressed to Read It Later, Inc., creator of Pocket</a></h2>
                <div class="summary"><p>On thursday, January the 23th 2014 I received from the law firm Shartsis Friese LLP a Cease &amp; Desist letter labelled <strong>Trademark Infringement by "In the poche"</strong>.</p>
<p><em>poche</em> is a free (as in freedom) and open source application which allows saving Web contents for further reading developed by a single French individual (based in France). Its website is hosted at <a href="http://www.wallabag.org">http://www.inthepoche.com</a> and its source code is freely available at <a href="https://github.com/wallabag/wallabag">https://github.com/wallabag/wallabag</a>.</p>
<p>Here are the claims:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I'm using the name <em>poche</em> — which is the French translation for the word Pocket — as well as mentionning read-it-later</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The poche <em>logo</em>, which pictures a pocket, looks like yours</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In this tweet <a href="https://twitter.com/wallabagapp/status/423786365944225792">https://twitter.com/wallabagapp/status/423786365944225792</a>, I'm supposed to depict Pocket as being unfree</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>And here are the required actions I'm told by your lawyers before January the 31th, 2014:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>cease and desist all infringing activity, including but not limited to  using "poche", "read-it-later" or the infringing logo in connection with  any software application</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>cease and desist from making any false statements of fact about Pocket  in connection with advertising any competing applications, including but  not limited to your assertion that Pocket is not free of charge to  users.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So here's an official statement of mine regarding these claims &amp; required actions:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I'm using the term <em>poche</em> for my app. This is indeed the French word for Pocket, but also a common word in French. Legally, nothing prevents me from using it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The logo will be updated, I've already updated the <em>poche</em> twitter account avatar accordingly <a href="http://twitter.com/wallabagapp">http://twitter.com/wallabagapp</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All occurences of the name read-it-later have been removed from <a href="http://wallabag.org">wallabag.org</a>, and I'll delete all posts mentionning it from my social network accounts in the upcoming days</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I've never defamed Pocket. I said on twitter that Pocket was a non-free application, which means proprietary software — which is actually true. To be nice to you, I've removed any mention of Pocket from the <em>poche</em> website where I simply mentioned that <em>poche</em> allows migration from a Pocket account to a poche one. Though if you don't mind I'll keep mentionning Pocket as an alternative to <em>poche</em> in this page <a href="http://www.inthepoche.com/poche-alternatives/">http://www.inthepoche.com/poche-alternatives/</a></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>To summarize, I'd like to hear directly from you (so we avoid lawyer noise) about these changes : I'd like to keep using the <em>poche</em> name, the inthepoche.com domain and the @getpoche twitter account. I'm removing all mention of Pocket from the website and won't ever be mentioning you again in any poche public communications. Last, the logo will be updated.</p>
<p>You can reach me at <a href="mailto:nicolas@loeuillet.org">nicolas@loeuillet.org</a>. Please don't call me by phone as I'm not fluent in English (this open letter has been translated by someone else).</p>
<p>Regards,
Nicolas</p>
